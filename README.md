    PURPOSE:	To change the palette of any screen at will in 24bit if on AGA or
		12bit if in ECS, of any pen number. This disobeys all palette sharing rules
		but who cares, so do most programs on custom screens, at least now you can
		change the palette to your hearts desire.

		The program opens up on the current screen, so you can call it from your own
		applications using the DOS.library call system()

    REQUIREMENTS:
            HardWare:     ECS or AGA or AAA or better.
            OS:            OS2.x (V37+) and above.
                     ( This has been tested on OS3.1 , and it works)
